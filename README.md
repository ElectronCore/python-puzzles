Fun &amp; random puzzles in python that I have no idea why you'd download!

v4.0/20.6/13: Added divisors.py; a program that brute force finds all divisors of any number inputted. Can easily turn computers into jet engines.

v3.0/20.6.12: Updated Odd_Even.py with more exception logic. Added list_less_than.py; a program that can be used to create a list of integers and then iterate over that list with a iteration key number to find which numbers are less than the key.

v2.0/20.6.10: Added Odd_Even.py; a small program that can take an input number and tell if its even, or take a dividend and a divisor and see if they divide evenly.

v1.0/20.6.6: Added Age_Year_Finder.py; a tiny program to figure out what year it will be when you are a certain age! Interrupts and exceptions included, try to break it!
