Fun &amp; random puzzles in python that I have no idea why you'd download!

v.2/20.6.10: Added Odd_Even.py; a small program that can take an input number and tell if its even, or take a dividend and a divisor and see if they divide evenly.

v1.0/20.6.6: Added Age_Year_Finder.py; a tiny program to figure out what year it will be when you are a certain age! Interrupts and exceptions included, try to break it!
