##Fun &amp; random puzzles in python that I have **_no_** idea why you'd download!

_**v6.5/20.6.24:**_ Added *rps_2.0.py*; a complete redesign and overhaul of the rps game from yesterday with more class and object-oriented design.

_**v6.0/20.6.23:**_ Added and updated *rps.py*; a super dumb and overly complex rock-paper-scissors game with full player name functionality and easy input functions.

_**v5.0/20.6.14:**_ Added *list_less_than.py*; a program that prints out numbers in a list that are less than a specific number. Can append to the list.

_**v4.0/20.6/13:**_ Added *divisors.py*; a program that brute force finds all divisors of any number inputted. Can easily turn computers into jet engines.

_**v3.0/20.6.12:**_ Updated *Odd_Even.py* with more exception logic. Added list_less_than.py; a program that can be used to create a list of integers and then iterate over that list with a iteration key number to find which numbers are less than the key.

_**v2.0/20.6.10:**_ Added *Odd_Even.py*; a small program that can take an input number and tell if its even, or take a dividend and a divisor and see if they divide evenly.

_**v1.0/20.6.6:**_ Added *Age_Year_Finder.py*; a tiny program to figure out what year it will be when you are a certain age! Interrupts and exceptions included, try to break it!
